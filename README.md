# car-efficiency-ML-pipeline
Building an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to calculate the efficiency of car models, given the other attributes

Dataset used: https://github.com/khadeamol/car-efficiency-ML-pipeline

* The pipeline built performs the following operations on the dataset: 
  - Impute missing values
  - Builds custom attributes
  - One Hot encoding for categorical variables
* scikit-learn methods used: Stratified Shuffle split, Train Test split, One Hot encoding, Simple Imputer, Standard Scaler, Column Transformer
* Models evaluated: Linear regression, Decision Tree regressor, Random Forest regressor, Support Vector Machine regressor
